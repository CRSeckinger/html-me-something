            <h3 id="heading-color">History</h3>
            <p>     Paris was "discovered" by the Romans in 300 BC. Between 300BC to 2020AD, Paris underwent conflicts
                within the Roman control, the introduction of Christianity, several Kings, the boom of the Renaissance,
                and a revolution. This also includes the foundation of several well known tourist attractions, including
                the Louvre and Notre Dame. There are over 130 museums in Paris, not including several attractions and monuments that 
                are a piece of the history of this city.
                Any trip to Paris wouldn't be complete without exploring the history, even if it is the select history that interests the traveller. 
                To get a feel of the history of the city, visiting any of these historical sites is a good start. When planning a trip, make sure to
                note hours, cost, busy season, and cultural norms so you don't stand out as a tourist.</p>

            <h3 id="heading-color">Culture</h3>
            <p>     Whether you are an avid traveler or rarely leave home, you can see that Paris is a unique city.
                There is an essence about this city that makes it magical and romantic. For some, it is hard to explain,
                but for others, it is recognizing a lot of different elements that create this effect. Like history, Parisians
                revere art. They admire both pieces that are historic and the modern. There is also the architecture. 
                Paris has notable architecture from every period, from the Middle Ages to the 21st century. It is the birthplace
                of the Gothic styles, boomed during the Renaissance, and has notes of the flamboyant Napolean III.
                    If you want to fully absorb the architecture of Paris, you must <em>la Fla&#770;nerie</em>. 
                La Fla&#770;nerie is a French word that means to 'wander the streets of Paris'. Paris was built with 
                many smaller, winding side streets that many have access to only smaller vehicles and pedestrians. Some may surprise you with 
                gardens, flowers, decorated balconies, flags, and neighbors sitting out and enjoying the day. While walking you will also find
                the open air cafe&#769;s with lots of people watching, a variety of cultures amoungst the food choices, flea markets, open air farmers markets, and people 
                relaxing on the Seine River bank.
                    As you explore the city, you will notice that before anyone speaks to you, they properly greet you. This is true for all shopkeepers,
                hosts, and strangers. Parisians have a sterotype of being rude or cold, when in reality they prefer introductions before talking to someone
                they do not know. You may notice several open cafe&#769;s with sidewalk seating. Parisians love to people watch, especially the tourists.
                This should lead you to two conclusions: 1.) you will notice people watching you, and 2.) you should follow suite....grab a table and enjoy
                your meal and watch. Parisians look at mealtime as a time to relax, enjoy the food, wine, and company. This is also why food is a large part
                of Paris. </p>

            <h3 id="heading-color">Food</h3>
            <p>     This is the one trip where you MUST avoid chain restaurants and fast food. I know every trip has those days were schedules 
                are tight and you want something to grab and go, but this is not the city to do this. It would take months to eat through all of Paris,
                and there are several great restaurant options depending on what kind of food you are interested in. Instead of giving specific recommendations,
                there are types of food that you should focus on trying, each available in any of the city districts that might be easier for you to navigate. Maybe 
                things taste better because it's Paris, or vacation, or maybe it is just better.
                <ol>
                    <li>Baguettes - one of the simplist items to find and eat. Any bakery or <em>boulangerie</em> will have them, often costing just a few coins.</li>
                    <li>Croissants and Macarons - France is known for great pasteries, these are just two common types. Both can be found at local bakeries and pastry shops, and
                        if there is a line, you know you found a good one. </li>
                    <li>French Cheeses - The French often take pitty that American process all their cheese. There are so many types of cheese, go to the <em>Formagerie</em>
                        (yes, there are cheese only stores, it is heaven) and talk to the cheesemonger. Even if they don't speack perfect english and you don't know french, you
                        will find some amazing cheeses to try.</li>
                    <li>Falafel and/or Couscous - Surprised? Paris is a great blend of cultures and it reflects in their food choices. Parisians welcome 
                        all cultures and their food. Some of the restaurants with the best falafel in Paris often have a line daily. </li>
                    <li>Steak frites - Steak and fries, what could go wrong? It is a staple you will find at both low cost cafe&#769;s and high-end steak houses.</li>
                    <li>Croque Madame/Monsieur - Basically a hot ham and cheese sandwich that is so much better than anything in America. Choosing an egg makes it a Croque Madame.
                        Rumored to be first served in 1910, it is a legendary lunch item that it the most strongly recommended.</li>
                    <li>Chocolate and Butter Salted Caramels - Paris has some great sweet items like much of Europe, but these two stand out the most.</li>
                </ol>
